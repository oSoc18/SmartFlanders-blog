title: What's next?
---

Our journey is over, we showed our tool on the demo day and talked to a lot of people about it. 
However, our tool is still a proof-of-concept and not ready to be deployed anywhere.

That's where the cities come in! We hope that the cities are now convinced by our tool and 
start with publishing their own catalogue, Linked Open Data, ... on their own website and let anyone benefit from their effort.

## The future is almost here

With our tool we brought the future a bit closer to today but we aren't there yet!
Our tool could still be extended to publish other things like trees, trash cans, ... 
and link this data to anything else in the city. Being open to your citizens is really important, 
that's something you can achieve with Linked Open Data!
